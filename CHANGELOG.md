# Changelog

## 0.5.5 — 2026-05-11

Pin: cross-skill audit fixes. Added `scripts/audit-cross-skill.js` (comprehensive accuracy checker) and ran it against the v0.5.4 state.

### Bugs found and fixed

| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `mcp-agent-trust` skill cited `RFC-8446` in catalog's `skills_referencing` but missing from skill's own `rfc_refs` (asymmetric reference) | Restored `RFC-8446` to skill's frontmatter + manifest entry |
| 2 | README badge `skills-25-` 13 stale | Bumped to `skills-38-` |
| 3 | README badge `jurisdictions-33-` 1 stale | Bumped to `jurisdictions-34-` |
| 4 | `researcher` skill body claimed "36 specialized skills downstream"; actual is 37 | Updated to 37 in both occurrences |

### New tooling

- `scripts/audit-cross-skill.js` — runs 15 cross-skill accuracy checks: manifest path existence, frontmatter ↔ manifest name parity, researcher-dispatch coverage, AGENTS.md Quick-Ref coverage, version triple agreement, snapshot drift, SBOM drift, every-catalog-ref-resolves, RFC reverse-ref symmetry, skill-update-loop affected-skills validity, stale renamed-skill tokens, trigger collisions, README badge drift, researcher count claim. Exit non-zero on any finding.
- Trigger collisions (13 informational) — all intentional fan-out per researcher dispatch policy (promptsteal/promptflux, compliance gap, mas trm, apra cps 234, defense in depth, tlpt, tiber-eu, csaf, blue team, workload identity, nerc cip, falco).

### Verification

- `node scripts/audit-cross-skill.js` → 0 issues
- 10/10 predeploy gates green
- 38/38 skills signed

## 0.5.4 — 2026-05-11

Pin-level rename + terminology cleanup. The `age-gates-minor-safeguarding` skill shipped in 0.5.3 has been renamed to `age-gates-child-safety`. Prose use of "minor" replaced with "child" / "children" / specific cohort terms ("under-13", "under-16", "under-18") throughout the skill body. Direct regulatory citations that use the word (CN Minors Protection Law, DSA Art. 28 wording, AVMSD "minor protection" terminology, Character.ai case reference) preserved verbatim.

### Public-surface change

This is a renamed skill (removed `age-gates-minor-safeguarding` + added `age-gates-child-safety`). The snapshot gate handled the additive rename via `npm run refresh-snapshot`. Downstream consumers pinned to the previous name should update their reference; the published name had only been on `main` for ~one commit.

### Files touched

- Directory rename: `skills/age-gates-minor-safeguarding/` → `skills/age-gates-child-safety/`
- Skill frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `triggers`
- Skill body: prose "minor" → "child" where context allowed (~71 of 86 occurrences); 15 remaining are regulatory citations preserved verbatim
- `manifest.json`: renamed entry + updated path + triggers
- `manifest-snapshot.json`: regenerated
- `AGENTS.md`: Quick Skill Reference row updated
- `skills/researcher/skill.md`: dispatch routing entry added (the rename surfaced that this skill was never wired into researcher dispatch in 0.5.3 — corrected here)
- `CHANGELOG.md`: 0.5.3 entry retroactively updated to use the new name
- SBOM refreshed

### Verification

- 10/10 predeploy gates green
- 38/38 skills signed and lint-passing

## 0.5.1 — 2026-05-11

Pin-level audit cleanup. Closes the final orphans surfaced by the cross-skill audit.

### Orphan closures via citation backfill

- **10 CWE orphans → 0** through citations in existing skills:
  - CWE-22 / CWE-77 / CWE-352 / CWE-434 / CWE-918 cited in `mcp-agent-trust` (MCP HTTP transport weakness classes) and `attack-surface-pentest` (pen-test scope).
  - CWE-269 / CWE-732 cited in `identity-assurance` (privilege management) and `attack-surface-pentest`.
  - CWE-125 / CWE-362 cited in `kernel-lpe-triage` (memory + concurrency kernel classes) and `fuzz-testing-strategy`.
  - CWE-1188 cited in `policy-exception-gen` and `security-maturity-tiers` (insecure-defaults posture).
- **1 framework_gap orphan → 0**: `ISO-IEC-23894-2023-clause-7` cited in `ai-attack-surface` and `threat-modeling-methodology`.

### Cumulative orphan state across all catalogs

| Catalog | Orphans | Total entries |
|---|---|---|
| `data/atlas-ttps.json` | 0 | (full) |
| `data/cve-catalog.json` | 0 | 5 |
| `data/cwe-catalog.json` | 0 | 34 |
| `data/d3fend-catalog.json` | 0 | 21 |
| `data/rfc-references.json` | 0 | 19 |
| `data/framework-control-gaps.json` | 0 | 49 |

Every entry across every catalog is now referenced by ≥1 skill.

### Verification

- 10/10 predeploy gates green (Ed25519 / tests / catalog / offline-CVE / offline-RFC / snapshot / lint / watchlist / catalog-meta / SBOM-currency)
- 132/132 tests passing
- All 25 skills re-signed; manifest snapshot regenerated additively

## 0.5.0 — 2026-05-11

**Cross-skill cohesion + foundational expansion completion.** Closes the orphan framework gaps the cross-skill audit identified, expands jurisdiction coverage, completes the hand-off DAG between skills.

### Four new skills (21 → 25)

Each closes a previously orphaned framework_gap and ships with the full 7-required-section contract plus the optional 8th Defensive Countermeasure Mapping plus a `## Hand-Off / Related Skills` section.

- **`identity-assurance`** — Closes the `NIST-800-63B-rev4` orphan. NIST 800-63 AAL/IAL/FAL, FIDO2/WebAuthn passkeys, OIDC/SAML/SCIM federation, agent-as-principal identity, short-lived workload tokens, OAuth 2.0 + RFC 9700 BCP. References RFC 7519/8725/6749/9700/8032.
- **`ot-ics-security`** — Closes the `NIST-800-82r3`, `IEC-62443-3-3`, `NERC-CIP-007-6-R4` orphans. NIST 800-82r3, IEC 62443-3-3, NERC CIP, IT/OT convergence, AI-augmented HMI threats, ATT&CK for ICS (T0855, T0883).
- **`coordinated-vuln-disclosure`** — Process skill: ISO 29147 (disclosure) + ISO 30111 (handling), VDP, bug bounty, CSAF 2.0 advisories, security.txt (RFC 9116), EU CRA Art. 11 / NIS2 Art. 12 regulator-mandated disclosure, AI vulnerability classes.
- **`threat-modeling-methodology`** — Methodology skill: STRIDE, PASTA, LINDDUN (privacy), Cyber Kill Chain, Diamond Model, MITRE Unified Kill Chain v3, AI-system threat modeling, agent-based threat modeling.

### Cross-skill graph fixes

- **DAG hand-off backfill**: 5 v0.4.0 skills had IN-DEGREE 0 (no skill mentioned them — including the dispatcher); 4 v0.3.0 skills had OUT-DEGREE 0 (leaf with no hand-off). Both fixed. `researcher` dispatch table now routes to all 24 specialized skills with explicit disambiguation policy for 4 trigger collisions (`promptsteal`/`promptflux` fan-out, `compliance gap`, `defense in depth`, `zero trust`). Four former-leaf skills (`kernel-lpe-triage`, `mcp-agent-trust`, `rag-pipeline-security`, `ai-c2-detection`) gained `## Hand-Off / Related Skills` sections.
- **CWE/D3FEND cross-reference backfill**: 16 of 21 skills carried zero `cwe_refs` and 19 of 21 carried zero `d3fend_refs` in manifest entries pre-v0.5.0. Comprehensive backfill applied — D3FEND orphans dropped from 20/20 to 0/20 (every defensive technique now cited by ≥1 skill).
- **Frontmatter dedup pass** — fixed double-`d3fend_refs` blocks introduced by the bulk sync in 3 skills.

### Jurisdiction expansion (22 → 33)

`data/global-frameworks.json` grew from 22 to 33 entries (v1.2.0 → v1.3.0). New nation-state jurisdictions: NO (Norway), MX (Mexico), AR (Argentina), TR (Turkey), TH (Thailand), PH (Philippines). New US sub-national: US_CALIFORNIA (CCPA + CPRA + CPPA + AI Transparency Act). New EU sub-regulators (split out from monolithic EU block): EU_DE_BSI (Germany IT-Grundschutz + TR-02102 crypto), EU_FR_ANSSI (RGS + PASSI + LPM), EU_ES_AEPD (most active GDPR enforcer + AESIA AI agency), EU_IT_AgID_ACN (Italian Perimetro), EU_ENISA (EUCC/EUCS-Cloud certification schemes).

### Update-loop integration

`skill-update-loop` got 4 new skills wired into Triggers 4, 5, and 9. New **Trigger 10: Threat Modeling Methodology Updates** added for STRIDE/LINDDUN/Unified Kill Chain revisions.

### Governance doc refresh

`README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `AGENTS.md` Quick Skill Reference table all updated to reflect 25 skills, 10 data catalogs, 33 jurisdictions.

### Verification

- 25/25 skills passing lint
- 132/132 tests passing
- 7/7 predeploy gates passing
- DAG: 0 skills with in-degree 0, 0 skills with out-degree 0
- Orphans: 0 ATLAS, 0 D3FEND, 0 RFC, 0 CVE, 16/34 CWE (unallocated weakness classes — documented gap), 13/49 framework_gaps reduced via the 4 new skills to 9/49 (remaining 9 are sectoral gaps requiring future sector skills)

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-11

**Foundational expansion pass.** Catches the gaps a deeper-research audit surfaced: CWE / D3FEND / EPSS / DLP / supply-chain / pen-testing / fuzz / ISO 42001 / additional jurisdictions / vendor advisories.

### New data catalogs
- **`data/cwe-catalog.json`** — 30 CWE entries pinned to CWE v4.17. Covers 19 of CWE Top 25 (2024) plus AI/ML / supply-chain entries (CWE-1395, CWE-1426, CWE-1357, CWE-494, CWE-829). Each entry cross-walks to evidence_cves, capec, framework controls, and skills_referencing.
- **`data/d3fend-catalog.json`** — 21 MITRE D3FEND defensive techniques pinned to D3FEND v1.0.0. Counter-mapped to ATT&CK and ATLAS techniques. Each entry carries `ai_pipeline_applicability` per AGENTS.md hard rule #9.
- **`data/dlp-controls.json`** — 21 DLP control entries spanning channel (LLM-prompt, MCP-tool-arg, clipboard-AI, code-completion, IDE-telemetry), classification (regex, ML, embedding-match, watermark), surface (RAG corpus, embedding store, training data), enforcement (block/redact/coach), and evidence (audit, forensics).

### Catalog augmentation
- **`data/cve-catalog.json`** — Every CVE entry gets `epss_score`, `epss_percentile`, `epss_date`, `epss_source` fields. `_meta.epss_methodology` explicitly documents that scores are estimates derived from public catalog signals (KEV, PoC, AI-discovery, blast radius) pending live FIRST API replacement on the next `validate-cves --live` run.
- **`data/framework-control-gaps.json`** — 26 new entries: ISO/IEC 42001:2023, ISO/IEC 23894, OWASP LLM Top 10 (LLM01/02/06/08), OWASP ASVS v5.0, NIST 800-218 SSDF, NIST 800-82r3, NIST 800-63B rev4, IEC 62443-3-3, FedRAMP Rev5, CMMC 2.0, HIPAA Security Rule, HITRUST CSF v11.4, NERC CIP-007-6, PSD2 RTS-SCA, SWIFT CSCF v2026, SLSA Build L3, VEX/CSAF v2.1, CycloneDX 1.6, SPDX 3.0, OWASP Pen Testing Guide v5, PTES, NIST 800-115, CWE Top 25 meta-control. Catalog grew from 23 to 49 entries.
- **`data/global-frameworks.json`** — 8 new jurisdictions: BR (LGPD), CN (PIPL+DSL+CSL), ZA (POPIA), AE (UAE PDPL), SA (KSA PDPL), NZ (Privacy Act 2020), KR (PIPA), CL (Law 19.628 + 2024 amendments). `IN` block enriched with DPDPA alongside the existing CERT-In entry; `CA` enriched with Quebec Law 25 and PIPEDA. `_notification_summary` rolled up across 21 jurisdictions.
- **`sources/index.json`** — 15 new primary sources registered: EPSS API, OSV.dev (promoted), CSAF 2.0, STIX/TAXII (export target), MISP, VulnCheck KEV, CWE, CAPEC, MITRE ATT&CK (pinned v17 / 2025-06-25), D3FEND, SSVC, SLSA, Sigstore, plus a `vendor_advisories` block listing MSRC, RHSA, USN, Apple, Cisco, Oracle, SUSE, Debian DSA, Google ASB.

### Version pinning (AGENTS.md hard rule #12)
- **MITRE ATT&CK v17** (2025-06-25) now pinned at `manifest.json` top level alongside ATLAS v5.1.0. Manifest snapshot tracks both.
- **CWE v4.17, CAPEC v3.9, D3FEND v1.0.0** pinned in `sources/index.json`.

### Frontmatter spec extension
- New optional skill frontmatter fields: `cwe_refs`, `d3fend_refs`, `dlp_refs`. Each validates against the corresponding catalog. Schema in `lib/schemas/skill-frontmatter.schema.json`. Manifest snapshot now diffs these fields.
- New optional 8th body section: `## Defensive Countermeasure Mapping`. Required for skills shipped on or after 2026-05-11; pre-existing skills are exempt until their next minor version bump.
- `## Analysis Procedure` must now explicitly thread **defense in depth, least privilege, and zero trust** as foundational design dimensions (not optional considerations).

### Five new skills (16 → 21)
- **`attack-surface-pentest`** — Modern attack surface management + pen testing methodology. NIST 800-115, OWASP WSTG v5, PTES, ATT&CK-driven adversary emulation, TIBER-EU. AI-surface (APIs, MCP, RAG, embedding stores) included in scope.
- **`fuzz-testing-strategy`** — Continuous fuzzing as security control. AFL++, libFuzzer, syzkaller, RESTler, garak, AI-augmented fuzz (OSS-Fuzz pipelines, Microsoft AIM). NIST 800-218 SSDF gap.
- **`dlp-gap-analysis`** — DLP gaps for mid-2026: legacy DLP misses LLM prompts, MCP tool args, RAG retrievals, embedding-store exfiltration, code-completion telemetry. Layered defense across SDK logging / proxy inspection / endpoint DLP / egress NTA.
- **`supply-chain-integrity`** — SLSA Build L3+, in-toto attestations, Sigstore signing, SBOM (CycloneDX 1.6 / SPDX 3.0), VEX via CSAF 2.0, AI-generated code provenance, model weights as supply-chain artifacts.
- **`defensive-countermeasure-mapping`** — Meta-skill mapping offensive findings (CVE / TTP / framework gap) to MITRE D3FEND defensive techniques with explicit defense-in-depth layer, least-privilege scope, zero-trust posture, AI-pipeline applicability.

### Linter + snapshot gate updates
- `lib/lint-skills.js` validates `cwe_refs` against `data/cwe-catalog.json`, `d3fend_refs` against `data/d3fend-catalog.json`, `dlp_refs` against `data/dlp-controls.json`.
- `scripts/check-manifest-snapshot.js` and `scripts/refresh-manifest-snapshot.js` include the three new ref fields in the public-surface diff.
- AGENTS.md skill format spec + Quick Skill Reference table updated for the 5 new skills.

### Verification
- 21/21 skills passing lint
- 132/132 tests passing
- 7/7 predeploy gates passing

## 0.3.0 — 2026-05-11

Pre-release: every CI gate green, full skill corpus compliant with the AGENTS.md hard rules.

### Vendor-neutrality refactor
- **Renamed `AGENT.md` → `AGENTS.md`** to align with the cross-vendor convention (OpenAI Codex CLI, Sourcegraph amp, Aider, Continue, Cline, Roo Code, Q Developer all auto-load `AGENTS.md`). `AGENTS.md` is the canonical agent-agnostic source for all internal citations and the **only** project-rules file shipped in the repo.
- **Removed `CLAUDE.md` entirely.** No per-vendor mirror is shipped. The earlier plan to maintain a byte-identical Claude Code mirror was dropped after recognizing that a globally-gitignored filename would never reach downstream consumers anyway. Claude Code users load `AGENTS.md` manually (`@AGENTS.md`) or via a per-machine `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` they configure themselves.
- **Added `.windsurfrules`** as a pointer stub for Windsurf's auto-load convention.
- **Bulk replaced all internal citations** (~20 files: `.github/workflows/*`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`, schemas, library code, scripts, skill bodies) so the project no longer privileges one vendor's filename when citing its own rules.
- **`README.md` AI Assistant Configuration table** now lists every major coding assistant — OpenAI Codex CLI, Anthropic Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Sourcegraph amp, Aider, Continue, Cline, Roo Code, Q Developer, Google Gemini CLI, JetBrains AI, Replit Agent — with explicit instructions for how each one picks up `AGENTS.md`.

### Skills (16th added)
- `researcher` — Top-level triage entry-point that classifies raw threat intel inputs (CVE ID, ATLAS TTP, framework control, incident narrative), researches them across every `data/*.json` catalog, applies RWEP scoring, and routes to the right downstream specialized skill with an EU/UK/AU/ISO global-jurisdiction surface. Closes the orchestration gap between operator and the 15 specialist skills.

### Pre-ship gate compliance
- Every CI gate now passes locally and in-workflow: `npm run predeploy` reports 6/6 green (Ed25519 signature verification, cross-OS tests, CVE catalog + zero-day learning loop validation, offline CVE state, manifest snapshot gate, skill lint).
- Lint compliance backfill: 14 skills updated to satisfy the 7-required-section body contract from CLAUDE.md without rewriting any existing content. Added sections preserve mid-2026 grounding, real CVE / ATLAS / framework refs, and RWEP-anchored prioritization throughout.
- Frontmatter completeness: `pqc-first`, `skill-update-loop`, `zeroday-gap-learn` now carry the full required field set (`atlas_refs`, `attack_refs`, `framework_gaps`) per the CLAUDE.md skill spec.

### Data
- `data/framework-control-gaps.json` — added `NIST-800-53-SC-7` (Boundary Protection) entry. Documents how AI-API C2 routes through allowlisted provider domains (api.openai.com, api.anthropic.com, generativelanguage.googleapis.com) and defeats boundary inspection. Maps to `AML.T0096`, `AML.T0017`, `T1071`, `T1102`, `T1568`. Closes the orphaned-reference gap that the lint gate caught in `ai-c2-detection`.

### Verification
- 110/110 tests passing (`npm test`)
- 16/16 skills passing lint (`npm run lint`)
- All 6 predeploy gates green (`npm run predeploy`)

- `.cursorrules` — Cursor-specific skill system config with MCP audit paths
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — GitHub Copilot skill system configuration

### Data completeness
- `data/atlas-ttps.json` — 9 MITRE ATLAS v5.1.0 TTPs with framework gap analysis and detection guidance
- `data/global-frameworks.json` — 14-jurisdiction GRC registry with patch SLAs and notification windows
- `data/framework-control-gaps.json` — Added 11 entries: NIS2-Art21-patch-management, NIST-800-53-CM-7, ISO-27001-2022-A.8.30, SOC2-CC9-vendor-management, NIST-800-53-SC-28, NIST-800-53-SI-12, NIST-AI-RMF-MEASURE-2.5, ISO-27001-2022-A.8.16, SOC2-CC7-anomaly-detection, CIS-Controls-v8-Control7 (11 total additions)
- `data/zeroday-lessons.json` — Added CVE-2026-43284 and CVE-2026-43500 lessons; now covers all 5 catalog CVEs

### RWEP formula correction
- **Bug fix**: `ai_factor` now applies to `ai_discovered` OR `ai_assisted_weaponization` (was: weaponization only)
- **Bug fix**: `reboot_required` now always adds +5 when patch requires reboot (was: conditional on !live_patch_available)
- **Blast radius scale**: extended from 0-15 to 0-30 to properly capture population-level risk
- **Recalculated RWEP scores** (all formula-consistent):
  - CVE-2026-31431: 90 (was 96 — narrative error)
  - CVE-2026-43284: 38 (was 84 — factors didn't sum to stored score)
  - CVE-2026-43500: 32 (was 81 — same)
  - CVE-2025-53773: 42 (was 91 — CVSS overscored; no KEV, suspected exploitation)
  - CVE-2026-30615: 35 (was 94 — CVSS dramatically overscored; supply-chain prerequisite)
- **Narrative**: Copy Fail (CVSS 7.8 / RWEP 90) vs Windsurf MCP (CVSS 9.8 / RWEP 35) demonstrates RWEP provides correct prioritization in both directions
- Added `live_patch_available`, `live_patch_tools`, `ai_discovered` to CVE_SCHEMA_REQUIRED
- Added `complexity_notes` field to CVE-2026-43500
- CVE-2026-43284 `live_patch_available` corrected to false (kpatch RHEL-only, not population-level available)

### Initial release

**Skills (14 — security-maturity-tiers added in 0.2.0):**
- `kernel-lpe-triage` — Linux kernel LPE assessment (Copy Fail, Dirty Frag)
- `ai-attack-surface` — Comprehensive AI/ML attack surface assessment (ATLAS v5.1.0)
- `mcp-agent-trust` — MCP trust boundary enumeration and hardening
- `framework-gap-analysis` — Framework control → current TTP gap analysis
- `compliance-theater` — Seven-pattern compliance theater detection
- `exploit-scoring` — Real-World Exploit Priority (RWEP) scoring
- `rag-pipeline-security` — RAG pipeline threat model (no framework coverage)
- `ai-c2-detection` — SesameOp/PROMPTFLUX/PROMPTSTEAL detection and response
- `policy-exception-gen` — Defensible exception templates for architectural realities
- `threat-model-currency` — 14-item threat model currency assessment
- `global-grc` — 14-jurisdiction GRC mapping with universal gap declaration
- `zeroday-gap-learn` — Zero-day learning loop (CVE → control gap → framework gap)
- `pqc-first` — Post-quantum cryptography first mentality with version gates and loopback learning
- `skill-update-loop` — Meta-skill for keeping all skills current

**Data files:**
- `data/cve-catalog.json` — CVE-2026-31431, CVE-2026-43284, CVE-2026-43500, CVE-2025-53773, CVE-2026-30615
- `data/atlas-ttps.json` — MITRE ATLAS v5.1.0 TTPs for AI attack classes
- `data/framework-control-gaps.json` — NIST, ISO, SOC 2, PCI, NIS2, CIS documented gaps
- `data/global-frameworks.json` — 14-jurisdiction framework registry
- `data/exploit-availability.json` — PoC status and weaponization tracking
- `data/zeroday-lessons.json` — Learning loop output for 5 documented CVEs

**Infrastructure:**
- `sources/` — Primary source registry, validation protocol, multi-agent research verification
- `agents/` — threat-researcher, source-validator, skill-updater, report-generator definitions
- `reports/templates/` — Executive summary, compliance gap, zero-day response templates
- `lib/scoring.js` — RWEP scoring engine with schema validation
- `lib/ttp-mapper.js` — Control ID → TTP gap mapper

**Architecture:**
- Forward watch mechanism in every skill's YAML frontmatter
- Loopback learning encoded in skill-update-loop and pqc-first
- Source validation gate before any data enters the catalog
- Multi-agent coordination protocol (threat-researcher → source-validator → skill-updater → report-generator)
- RWEP scoring (CVSS + KEV + PoC + AI-acceleration + blast radius + live-patch factors)
- Compliance theater detection (7 patterns with specific detection tests)
- 14-jurisdiction global GRC coverage
- PQC version gates: OpenSSL 3.5+, Go 1.23+, Bouncy Castle 1.78+
- Hard algorithm deprecation table with sunset reasoning
